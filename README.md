# compression_resistance

The script "Automating_Comprssion_Resistance_I-section.py" uses the: 
      
      1) design load, 
      
      2) span, 
      
      3) young's modulus, and
      
      4) nature of the loading of the web and flange(beneding or compression) 
      
And determines the most efficient (smallest section size) memeber in the TATA STEEL SECTION Table database that can safely withstand the specified compressive load according to Eurocode 3 design protocols. 

To input your own paramemters in the script go to line 263 and specify the design load, span .... and run the script it 

In the terminal you should see the detailed breakdown of the design procedure.

For more info on the parameters see the __init__ method in lines 20-36.
